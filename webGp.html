            <p>
              By 2020, Romania was supposed to reach a recycling rate of 50% to
              avoid penalties from the European Union. The next threshold of 55%
              must be achieved by 2025. The recycling rate places the country at
              the bottom of the European Union, which is a major reason to
              contribute towards change. <br /><br />The primary objective is to
              support current and future initiatives for promoting and enhancing
              waste recycling with the intention of increasing community
              involvement in this ecological endeavor. On the web page, users
              can view the locations of recycling centers, information about
              rewards, the points needed for winning, and their own statistics
              if they are logged in. Users can only accumulate points by
              scanning or manually entering unique codes provided by automated
              recycling machines located at various centers, following the
              recycling of materials within the categories of plastic, metal,
              and paper.

                  In order to reach as many internet users as possible, a
                  complementary web application has been chosen to provide
                  information and guide users towards downloading the mobile app
                  for additional functionalities. <br />Android Studio, coupled
                  with the Kotlin programming language, was used to meet the
                  requirements of the mobile application, while ReactJS was used
                  for the web page. Data manipulation and user interface
                  communication were achieved using Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL
                  was employed for database management.

                <p>
                  The registration and login forms are created using the Formik
                  library, simplifying form state management and the handling of
                  external actions. To enforce desired constraints, the YUP
                  library is included to address cases where fields are left
                  incomplete or unselected before submission. Additionally, for
                  email and password validation, regex constraints for
                  predefined rules are introduced. Once authenticated, users are
                  allowed to navigate the leaderboard by viewing statistics of
                  active accounts.

                  In order to implement the display of recycling centers in a
                  user-friendly manner, an interactive map is developed by
                  integrating the Google Maps API and creating a corresponding
                  marker for each recycling center based on its latitude and
                  longitude. <br />Awards are presented in the form of a
                  suggestive photo carousel for each item, along with the points
                  required for winning through material recycling.

                  trouble-free manner. Design elements are responsive to provide
                  a pleasant experience regardless of the device categories
                  used. To maintain a cohesive user experience, design elements,
                  such as color schemes, typography, and layout, are consistent
                  throughout the application. This consistency not only enhances
                  usability but also reinforces brand identity.

              The website has the potential to become much more interactive and
              useful, in addition to its promotional benefits, although the main
              action is represented by the Android application. This heartfelt
              project has the following future development objectives: Inclusion
              of a suggestive demo of the Android mobile application's usage,
              representation of the locations associated with existing accounts
              by adding markers on the map, and inclusion of authentic articles
              regarding the recycling situation in Romania to enhance
              motivation.
