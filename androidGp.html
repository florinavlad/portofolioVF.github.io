              The Android application encompasses all the available
              functionalities of the Greenpanion project, enabling the
              accumulation of points and the earning of rewards through
              recycling. General project information is also found in the

              navigation to recycling centers, viewing rewards, adding recycling
              points, validation of acquired points, automatic email
              notifications for rewards, displaying user rankings and review

                  The main opening screen of the application contains the
                  options for "Authentication" and "Registration" assigned to
                  the illustrated buttons. In accordance with the context in
                  which the user finds themselves, they can press one of the
                  buttons and will be redirected to the corresponding form. The
                  login process is achieved through the verification of the
                  backend token, utilizing the methods provided by Spring
                  Security, thus ensuring security and authentication for users.
                  Connection to the common server is essential, ensuring that a
                  user has the same experience, functionality, constraints and
                  validations on both the web application forms and the Android
                  application.

                  The first menu option is designed for familiarizing yourself
                  with the application, containing a multi-page viewing element
                  that can be scrolled through. Each of these pages represents
                  the steps for using the application and helps you with
                  recycling.<br /><br />For the second option in the main menu,
                  'Rewards and Recycling Centers,' the user has the possibility
                  to view and zoom in on the map provided with markers for each
                  center. Additionally, if the user's location is entered in the
                  first field, the desired recycling center is selected from the
                  available list, and upon clicking the button for navigation,
                  the user is redirected directly to the route on Google Maps.

                  By choosing "My Statistics" from the main menu, the user is
                  transferred to the Statistics screen corresponding to the
                  first image above. Points are initialized with 0 for a new
                  account, the application offers two ways to add points. The
                  logic used is that the person using the application recycles
                  to one of the vending machines, therefore receiving a QR code
                  and a unique identification code for the materials and
                  quantity recycled. <br /><br />
                  The QR code scanning functionality can be accessed by clicking
                  on the "Scan code", pressing on the side of the device turns
                  on the flashlight for visibility. In theory, the scanner
                  converts the QR code into transferable points directly into
                  app.
                  <br /><br />
                  There is also the option to manually add points by selecting
                  materials and their quantity, the app calculates the total and
                  then transmits the the user to the next validation screen. In
                  this context, the unique code returned from the automatic so
                  that the points are saved and valid in the main Statistics
                  screen.
